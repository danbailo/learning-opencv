# Learning OpenCV

## How i'm studying?

Hello guys, i'm started studying this library because I need to use it in my research. Even I know anythings about it, I decided read the basics of the documentation. So, I'm using the following link to study:

https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html

The language of programming that I'm using is the Python and the version of OpenCV is 4.2.

## Goals

My motivations and goals to started it is, I want to learn to handle images and videos without use google whenever appers a simple doubt. I want to know too, how Trackers works, I think that if I got a good base of the basics, I will go get a sucess to proceed with my research.

A part of my research involves trackers and a cut images. It also involves Machine Learning so, this library is essential to me!

## Structure of repository

I'm use the same structure of OpenCV documentation:

* [Introduction to OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/da/df6/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_setup.html)

	*I skipped this section.*

	I recommend this tutorial to install OpenCV in your computer - https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/15/how-to-install-opencv-4-on-ubuntu/.

	*In my case, I haven't use a virtual enviroment, but, works the same way!*


* [Gui Features in OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/dc/d4d/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_gui.html)

	Here you will learn how to display and save images and videos, control mouse events and create trackbar.

	* [Getting Started with Images](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/dc/d2e/tutorial_py_image_display.html) - done.

	* [Getting Started with Videos](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/dd/d43/tutorial_py_video_display.html) - doing.

	* [Drawing Functions in OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/dc/da5/tutorial_py_drawing_functions.html) - to do.

	* [Mouse as a Paint-Brush](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/db/d5b/tutorial_py_mouse_handling.html) - to do.

	* [Trackbar as the Color Palette](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/d9/dc8/tutorial_py_trackbar.html) - to do.

* [Core Operations]()

In this section you will learn basic operations on image like pixel editing, geometric transformations, code optimization, some mathematical tools etc.

* [Image Processing in OpenCV]()

In this section you will learn different image processing functions inside OpenCV.

* [Feature Detection and Description]()

In this section you will learn about feature detectors and descriptors

* [Video analysis (video module)]()

In this section you will learn different techniques to work with videos like object tracking etc.

* [Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction]()

In this section we will learn about camera calibration, stereo imaging etc.

* [Machine Learning]()

In this section you will learn different image processing functions inside OpenCV.

* [Computational Photography]()

In this section you will learn different computational photography techniques like image denoising etc.

* [Object Detection (objdetect module)]()

In this section you will learn object detection techniques like face detection etc.

* [OpenCV-Python Bindings]()

In this section, we will see how OpenCV-Python bindings are generated
